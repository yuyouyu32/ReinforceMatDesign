    "test = \"\"\"Based on the RULE set provided for evaluating high-entropy alloy components for their potential to form bulk metallic glasses (BMGs), I will evaluate the given DATA point for the BMG \"Zr54Cu16Ni9Al7Gd6\":\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Average atomic size difference**: Gd generally has a significantly different atomic radius compared to other elements such as Zr, Cu, Ni, and Al. The presence of Gd in the alloy is beneficial for inducing atomic size mismatch, thereby promoting glass formation. Without specific atomic radii values, a quantitative calculation can't be provided here, but it is expected to be greater than 12%.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **High mixing entropy**: This BMG has five principal elements with each constituent between 5% and 35%, which aligns with the optimal composition range for high mixing entropy.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Negative heat of mixing**: The combination of Zr with late transition metals (Cu, Ni) and Al typically leads to negative heats of mixing, which is favorable for glass formation and stabilization.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modulus contrast**: The alloy contains elements such as Zr and Gd, which are known for their high modulus, suggesting a favorable modulus contrast among the constituents.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Tg/Tl ratio**: The given Tg (Glass Transition Temperature) and Tl (Liquidus Temperature) allow for a ratio calculation: Tg/Tl = 561.6289809326661 / 1052.062571049757 â‰ˆ 0.534. Although this ratio is lower than the ideal value of 0.6, it is still within a reasonable range indicating good thermal stability.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Balanced ratio of transition metals with Zr or Ti**: The BMG has a balanced ratio of late transition metals (Cu, Ni) to Zr. However, there's no presence of Ti, which could otherwise enhance amorphization tendencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Variety of elements**: There is a variety of elements present in the alloy, which helps in maintaining complexity and inhibiting crystalline phase formation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering these factors and the performance data of real BMGs, the `Zr54Cu16Ni9Al7Gd6` alloy seems to have promising attributes for forming BMGs. However, the Tg/Tl ratio is slightly below the ideal value, and there might be potential improvements by adjusting the composition further to enhance moduli contrast or include Ti.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, my evaluation is:\n",
    "\n",
    "{\n",
    "    \"score\": 0.85,\n",
    "    \"reason\": \"The BMG composition shows a high potential for glass formation due to a high entropy mix of five principal elements, negative heat of mixing, and a good modulus contrast among constituents. However, the Tg/Tl ratio is slightly lower than ideal, and there is room for enhancement in the composition to increase the possibility of amorphous phase stabilization.\"\n",
